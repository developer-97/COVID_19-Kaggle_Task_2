Jupyter Notebooks:

- Sequential and rather intuitive coding tool 
- Can run snippets of code at a time which is good for testing, can provide a narrative along with 
the code you have written, and is good for data visualization 
- Merging notebooks can be difficult (Is possible) and is not the best for version control.

Google Colab:

- Free cloud service that can serve as a development environment where you can upload jupyter 
notebooks
- Can collaborate on the same notebook at the same time (Similar to Google Docs) 
- Free GPU makes good speed
